It's like a kitchen in every leaf! \ud83c\udf31 Let me explain it step by step in simple words.\n\n**What is Photosynthesis?**\nPlants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) to make glucose (sugar for food) and oxygen (O\u2082 we breathe).\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n1. **Sunlight is captured**: Green pigment called chlorophyll in leaves absorbs sunlight. (Like how solar panels work!)\n2. **Ingredients collected**: Roots suck water from soil, leaves take CO\u2082 from air through tiny holes called stomata.\n3. **Chemical reaction**: Sunlight energy splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen + CO\u2082 makes glucose.\n4. **Products released**: Glucose stored as starch, oxygen given out into air.\n\n**Simple Equation**:\n6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O + Sunlight \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 (Glucose) + 6O\u2082\n\n**Indian Example**: In our paddy fields, rice plants do photosynthesis to grow grains we eat in dosa or biryani. Mango trees in villages use it to make sweet fruits!\n\nYou're doing great learning this!
