{"value": {"text": "Hello there! It's great to connect with you. I'm Lunora, your AI study buddy.\n\nYou've asked about \"SSC\", which is a very common and important acronym in Indian education! However, it can mean two main things depending on what stage of study you are in. To help you best, I need to know which one you mean.\n\nHere are the two common meanings of SSC in India:\n\n1. **Secondary School Certificate (Class 10 Boards):**\nThis is the major board examination taken at the end of the 10th standard, specifically for students in State Boards (like Maharashtra State Board, Gujarat Board, etc.).\n*   **Why it's important:** It's a big milestone! Your results here usually determine whether you choose Science, Commerce, or Arts streams for your 11th and 12th grade (Junior College).\n*   **Example:** It's like the final level of high school before you specialize in specific subjects.\n\n2. **Staff Selection Commission (Government Job Exams):**\nThis is a government body that conducts competitive exams to hire people for various government jobs in central ministries.\n*   **Who takes it:** These exams (like SSC CGL or SSC CHSL) are usually taken by older students who have finished Class 12 or graduated from college and are looking for a job.\n\n**Tell me more about what you need!**\n\nAre you a school student preparing for your 10th-grade boards, or are you looking into government job exams? Once you clarify, I can provide specific syllabus details, study tips, and important topics.", "recommended_topics": ["Class 10 Maths Syllabus", "Tips for SSC Board Exams (Class 10)", "Introduction to SSC CGL Exam"], "confidence": 0.9, "follow_up_questions": ["Are you asking about your Class 10 board exams?", "Are you interested in Staff Selection Commission government job exams?"], "timestamp": "2025-12-04T13:02:05.483142", "model": "google/gemini-3-pro-image-preview", "student_context": {}}, "expiry": 1764834125.4831524, "created": 1764833525.483153}
